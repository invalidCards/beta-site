# ðŸ’µ Donations
None of the bots that I host are paid for. All of the bots still cost money to host, though, and I'm paying that out of pocket simply because I enjoy creating bots. However, this page is dedicated to those who want to give back - if you've ever enjoyed any of my bots and feel like you want to make a donation, this is the place to go! **You don't have to donate if you can't or don't want to - I'll still be providing all of my bots for free!** Anything you can spare is incredibly welcome, though.
