# ðŸ’µ Donations
None of the bots that I host are paid for. All of the bots still cost money to host, though, and I'm paying that out of pocket simply because I enjoy creating bots. However, this page is dedicated to those who want to give back - if you've ever enjoyed any of my bots and feel like you want to make a donation, this is the place to go! **You don't have to donate if you can't or don't want to - I'll still be providing all of my bots for free!** Anything you can spare is incredibly welcome, though.

## How to donate
### Patreon
#### [patreon.com/invalidCards](https://patreon.com/invalidCards)
On my Patreon, you can support me with a monthly payment. If you decide to contribute enough, I can even make and host a bot for you! Additionally, goals have been set on a total amount per month, with which I can upgrade the hardware the bots are running on.

### Fiverr
#### [fiverr.com/invalidcards](https://fiverr.com/invalidcards)
Fiverr is another great way to get one of my bots for you personally. There are three tiers available in my gig, with the cheapest getting you just the bot files and a limited amount of changes, and the more expensive ones also including hosting. These are a one-time payment rather than a recurring subscription, so if you feel like you want a bot for the long haul, this might be a cheaper option for you.

### Ko-Fi
#### [ko-fi.com/invalidCards](https://ko-fi.com/invalidCards)
Using Ko-Fi, you can make me a direct donation in increments of $3. Doing this will not give you any perks, but does go towards hosting the bots and is a great help to me regardless. Additionally, you can make the message private, which will make the donation anonymous if you so wish.

### PayPal.me
#### [paypal.me/ThePsionic](https://paypal.me/ThePsionic)
If you want to donate an amount other than an increment of $3 and you don't mind me seeing your legal name, you can also donate to me through PayPal.me. This method is generally preferred for very large donations (over $50 in one transaction).

## Supporters
A huge thanks to everyone who has donated to me! Below they are listed in order from most to least donated, but remember, it's not a competition! Your contribution is greatly appreciated no matter how much it is. (Those donating through Patreon have their total over time listed here.)
