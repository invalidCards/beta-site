# ðŸ¤– Discord bots
## ðŸŸ¢ GloopyBot { [Code](https://gitlab.com/weirdgloop/gloopybot) | [Invite](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=393024915755761674&scope=bot&permissions=330752) }
A bot for linking to the Weird Gloop family of wikis (such as the [RuneScape](https://rs.wiki) and [OldSchool RuneScape](https://osrs.wiki) wikis) as well as [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org).

## ðŸŸ  WikiaLinker { [Code](https://github.com/invalidCards/WikiaLinker) | [Invite](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=182146444357140480&scope=bot&permissions=3072) }
The precursor to GloopyBot, this bot can be used to link to any community on [Fandom](https://fandom.com) and is highly configurable. Development is discontinued, but the bot is still live for those who wish to use it.

## ðŸ”´ GooGlr { [Code](https://github.com/invalidCards/GooGlr) | ~~Invite~~ }
A somewhat simple bot to turn any link into a goo.gl link. This bot was shut down when [the service did](https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/03/transitioning-google-url-shortener.html) in March of 2019.

## ðŸŸ¢ A handful of other personal bots { ~~Code~~ | ~~Invite~~ }
I have made a fair few bots for personal use or made specifically for one person or community. These bots will not be released by me outside of their respective communities, and their code is not publicly available. If you have any questions about these bots or want to have your own, check out ways to reach me on the homepage of this website.
