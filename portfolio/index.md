## Main projects
### Discord bots
I mostly spend my time creating bots for [Discord](https://discordapp.com), a chat application mostly geared towards
gamers. Click [here](/bots) for the complete overview.

### New XKit (contributor)
New XKit is an extension framework for Tumblr made in Javascript, providing usability fixes and new functionality to the
site. The project has had 70 contributors since its creation by a developer named Atesh, which the New XKit team
picked up in August of 2015 after his sudden and unexplained disappearance from the internet. At the time of writing,
the project has approximately five active contributors, but anyone is welcome to add code to the project.
