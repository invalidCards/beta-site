## Main projects
### Discord bots
I mostly spend my time creating chat bots for [Discord](https://discordapp.com), a chat application mostly geared towards gamers. Click [here](/bots) for the complete overview.

### New XKit (contributor) { [Code](https://github.com/new-xkit/XKit) | [Website](https://new-xkit-extension.tumblr.com) }
New XKit is an extension framework for Tumblr made in Javascript, providing usability fixes and new functionality to the site. The project has had 70 contributors since its creation by a developer named Atesh, which the New XKit team picked up in August of 2015 after his sudden and unexplained disappearance from the internet. At the time of writing, the project has approximately five active contributors, but anyone is welcome to add code to the project.

## School projects
These projects were made several years ago during my time in school, and may not reflect the current level of my programming skills.

### Flight { [Code](https://notabug.org/psi/Flight) | [Website](https://notabug.org/psi/Flight/releases) }
Flight is a Unity game in which the player controls an airplane using a [Leap controller](https://www.leapmotion.com/), using tilts of the open palm. It was made in one week, so the edges are *very* rough, but it was fun to experiment with an alternative form of input.
