## Main projects
### Discord bots
I mostly spend my time creating chat bots for [Discord](https://discordapp.com), a chat application mostly geared towards gamers. Click [here](/bots) for the complete overview.

### New XKit (contributor) { [Code](https://github.com/new-xkit/XKit) | [Website](https://new-xkit-extension.tumblr.com) }
New XKit is an extension framework for Tumblr made in Javascript, providing usability fixes and new functionality to the site. The project has had 70 contributors since its creation by a developer named Atesh, which the New XKit team picked up in August of 2015 after his sudden and unexplained disappearance from the internet. At the time of writing, the project has approximately five active contributors, but anyone is welcome to add code to the project.

## Games and game prototypes
### FrogLeap { ~~Code~~ | [Website](https://invalidcards.itch.io/frogleap) }
A very early prototype for the [My First Game Jam Summer 2018 edition](https://itch.io/jam/my-first-game-jam-summer-2018). First time using Unity's tileset features, as well as using procedural generation to provide a random platforming experience every time. Incredibly unfinished and incredibly basic, but it's a concept I do want to explore further in the future.

## School projects
These projects were made several years ago during my time in school, and may not reflect the current level of my programming skills.

### Flight { [Code](https://notabug.org/psi/Flight) | [Website](https://notabug.org/psi/Flight/releases) }
Flight is a Unity game in which the player controls an airplane using a [Leap controller](https://www.leapmotion.com/), using tilts of the open palm. It was made in one week, so the edges are *very* rough, but it was fun to experiment with an alternative form of input.

### Roomstuck { ~~Code~~ | [Website](https://github.com/invalidCards/RoomStuck/releases/tag/roomstuck) }
A fairly simple and straight-forward room escape game made in Unity which heavily focussed on creating models in 3DS Max, adding animations in Unity, and the documentation behind the project.

### SburbJump { [Code](https://notabug.org/psi/SburbJump) | [Website](https://github.com/ThePsionic/thepsionic.github.io/releases/tag/sburbjump) }
A hybrid of an endless jumper with procedurally generated platforms and an RPG battle system, with crafting and equipment, developed for Android in Unity. Also features a JSON interpreter for easily adding items and enemies to the game without the need for any programming.

### Car { [Code](https://github.com/invalidCards/Car) | [Website](https://github.com/invalidCards/Car/releases/tag/car) }
A fairly simple city racer with three separate tracks including AI to race against. There was a lot of focus in making a full city in 3DS Max for this project.
