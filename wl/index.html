  <title>The end of WikiaLinker</title>
</head>
<body style="font-family:sans-serif;">
  <p>WikiaLinker will be <b>shut down</b> on November 7th, 2020. After that date, all user data will be deleted, and its <a href="https://github.com/invalidCards/WikiaLinker">GitHub repo</a> will be archived.</p>
  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <p>On this date, Discord are modifying its backend to use their new domain (discord.com instead of discordapp.com). This change seems small, but it means that discord.js, the library behind the bot, has to be updated as well. There are many breaking changes in that upgrade process, and I honestly don't think it is worth my time anymore.</p>
  <h2>Now what?</h2>
  <p>If you're using the bot to link to the RuneScape Wiki or any of its sister wikis, consider using <a href="https://gitlab.org/weirdgloop/gloopybot">GloopyBot</a> instead. It does all the same things, but for the new wiki.</p>
  <p>You may also find use out of <a href="https://github.com/invalidCards/WikiOperatingBuddy">Wiki Operating Buddy</a>, which links to a whole host of independently run gaming wikis.
  <h2>Can I try to revive it?</h2>
  <p>Feel free! The bot is open source, and all the information is available to host it yourself. I just won't be doing it anymore.</p>
  <h2>I have another question!</h2>
  <p>I'd be glad to answer it. Visit the <a href="https://discord.gg/runescapewiki">RuneScape Wiki Discord server</a> and look for <b>invalidCards#0380</b>. Shoot me a DM and I'll be happy to help you out.</p>
